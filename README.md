# BSit - Assignment, Frontend VueJS

Hello BSit team!
Hope you're ready for the review! Here you can find the frontend for the assignment.

## Instructions
Based on [this](https://github.com/ngryman/lol-champions/blob/master/champions.json) dataset, develop a web application served by a REST API. The application should display a list of the champions with a `load more` functionality and a detailed view by champion. The informations to display on the list and on the detailed view are up to you.

The code should be written in JavaScript, any library or framework can be used. The application can either be desktop, mobile, or both. You can send your code anytime you want, there's no dead line

## Dtails

I chose to build frontend using VueJS because I master it better, and for the backend, you can find the repo [here](https://github.com/KevinTss/bsit--assignment-backend-nodejs).

### Quick start

#### Prerequisite

You need Node installed on you machine

#### Command

```bash
git clone git@github.com:KevinTss/bsit--assignment-frontend-vuejs.git
cd bsit--assignment-frontend-vuejs && npm install && npm run serve
```

> In that use case, I have pushed the env folder because there are not real reasons to use it. The purpose is just to show how I work with environnement variables.
